rift-virtual
============

Welcome! This is a project that aims to use the Oculus Rift to improve virtual conferencing. The idea is to have two people in distinctly seperate concrete spaces meet in a virtual space. Their connection to the virtual space should be so immersive that all the things that are lost in a phone call or video messaging are replicated by their connection to the virtual space. Pretty ambitious huh? The technologies used are the Oculus Rift, OpenSim, and CtrlAltStudio viewer, so you'll definitely need them once you're ready to get started!
